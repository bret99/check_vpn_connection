# check_vpn_connection
This script launches VPN connection checking. Some times it's very critical to loose this one. You know..)))
Both scripts (start and stop) one may configure as menu items. For example in Mate DE one can add menu items
of not terminal app and write up 'bash -c "path_to_script"'.
Before to start 'check_vpn_start.sh' be sure about VPN connection is established.
